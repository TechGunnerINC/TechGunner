	<p class=" mx-[10rem]">
		Assalamu Alaikum Dear Visitor. I am <b class="b">Tech Gunner</b> <br />
		I'm <Type /> <br />
		from <b class="b">Islamabad, Pakistan.</b> <br />
		I am deeply honored that you've taken the time to explore <br>
		 my website, which I created
		with the help of <br>Bing's AI, ChatGPT. my staff is also 
		working hard to upgrade this platform to the <br />
		next level. However, creating this website wasn't easy for me.
		<br />
		I have some physical disabilities that affect my mobility and speech. <br />
		The Doctors said there's an issue in my brain that prevents it from
		<br />
		sending proper signals to my body parts. Which makes me unable
		<br />
		to walk or speak properly like a normal person. <br />
		Some Doctors said there is no treatment for my condition, <br />
		but I knew they were wrong because Allah SWT has treatment for everything. <br />
		I kindly request all visitors to pray to Allah SWT for my recovery from this disease. <br />
		Meanwhile, other Doctors said I can be recovered with proper therapy and medication. <br />
		Despite these challenges, I never gave up on my dreams and passions. <br />
		I am mentally perfect, I understand everything like a normal person. <br />
		After completing this website, I'm planning on writing a book about my journey, <br />
		Meanwhile, I will also try to learn some more programming languages to create a <br />
		Mobile app and an AI-powered talking toy car by the name of Aevin, <br />
		It will be able to climb walls and jump around, come to me when I call it, <br /> recognize me,
		and maybe even understand what I am saying, and a lot more. <br />
		My next project would be to create a translator for myself, <br />
		so everyone can understand me. However, it may sometimes provide wrong translations <br />
		due to the complexity of my speech. <br />
		Then I will work on a suit that will help me walk and control my body parts, 
		<br>
		and do those things that I wasn't able to do before,
		<br />		
		After that, I will learn hacking to hack and delete the dark web As the mission of our <br />
		company is to make the internet and the world a better place, <br /> Deleting the dark web will
		be worth it, it may reduce illegal activities and cybercrime, <br />
		and the internet may become much more secure and private. <br />I won't be working on this
		mission solo; I will assemble a team of Cyber Sharks. <br /> Once our company starts to generate
		good revenue, I will launch a service in which, <br />
		if you pay us 5000 PKR per week <br /> my company will pay your electricity bill. However, this
		service will only be available
		<br /> in Pakistan due to the economic crisis, and If my company achieves even more success,
		<br />I will open a restaurant where you will get everything up to 70% off, <br /> The food will
		be delicious and healthy, the service will be fast and friendly,
		<br />
		and the environment will be cozy and relaxing. <br /> I'm also planning on conquering the land
		of gaming and animation, <br />
		but I won't be able to do it without your support,
		<br />
		Behind the scenes, I will be working on a secret project, which I will reveal when I accomplish it,
		<br />
		It is something that has never been done before, something that may change the world, <br />
		something that may make history, <br />
		now I didn't mention all of my projects here because that would make the paragraph too long.
		<br />
		I hope you enjoyed reading about me.
		<br />
		Thank you for visiting my website. Don't forget to leave your feedback and suggestions. <br />
		Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments. Have a wonderful day!
		<br />
		<br />- Tech Gunner
